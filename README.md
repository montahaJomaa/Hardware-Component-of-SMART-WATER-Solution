#Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Treated Wastewater
The provided code enables real-time remote monitoring of treated wastewater parameters using the Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB) and an Arduino board with WiFi connectivity. The code uses the Firebase ESP8266 Arduino library for interacting with the Firebase RTDB.

#Components Used
Arduino board with WiFi connectivity (e.g., ESP8266-based board)
WiFi network credentials (SSID and password)
Firebase project API key
Authorized email and corresponding password for Firebase authentication

#Setup
Insert your WiFi network credentials, Firebase project API key, authorized email, and password in the respective definitions.
Initialize the WiFi connection by calling the initWiFi() function, which connects the Arduino board to the WiFi network.
Initialize the Firebase configuration and authentication objects (config and auth).
Reconnect to WiFi if the connection is lost (Firebase.reconnectWiFi(true)).
Set the Firebase response size (fbdo.setResponseSize(4096)).
Define the database paths for various wastewater parameters (databasePath, pHPath, CODPath, ConductivityPath, DOPath, TSSPath, AmmoniumPath, ChlorophyllPath, ChloridePath, ORPPath).

#Data Generation
Random float values are generated for each wastewater parameter using respective generateRandom functions (generateRandompH(), generateRandomCOD(), etc.).
Sending Data
The sendRandomDataTimer() function is called at regular intervals to send the randomly generated wastewater parameter values to the Firebase RTDB.
Firebase ready status and timer delay are checked to ensure the data is sent periodically.
The randomly generated parameter values are sent to the RTDB using the sendFloat() function, which writes the value to the specified path in the RTDB.
Helper Functions
generateRandompH(), generateRandomCOD(), and other similar functions generate random float values within specified ranges for each wastewater parameter.
initRandom() initializes the random seed using the analog reading from pin 0.

#Usage
Insert the required network credentials, Firebase API key, and authorized email/password.
Connect the Arduino board to the WiFi network.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Monitor the serial output to check the status of the WiFi connection and the data being sent to the Firebase RTDB.
